# Database
Input relation and its functional dependencies
NOTE: Needs MVD if 4NF is gonna be available

Output
- Closures
- Decomposition via 3NF / BCNF / 4NF(?)
- Minimal Basis / Cover


# To Do:
[] Accept Relation
[] Accept FDs
[] Output closures
[] Output minimal basis
[] Output BCNF Decomposition
[] Output 3NF Decomposition

# Optional To Do:
[] Accept MVD (optional)
[] Output 4NF Decomposition
[] Display step by step details
